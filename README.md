# Space-Invaders
A simplified replica of the classic arcade game Space Invaders, created for an assignment in COMP_SCI 376: Game Design and Development, taught by [Professor Ian Horswill](https://github.com/ianhorswill/CS376-student) at Northwestern University.
- **Version:** Unity 2022.3.47f1

## How to play
It's a classic, you know the rules. You're a little green guy shooting at aliens.

Your enemies are the white creatures moving from side to side. You are the little green guy at the very bottom, and you can move left and right, but not side to side.
The green things above you are bunkers you can shield yourself behind. If this game were better, these bunkers would deteriorate over time as they get hit with missiles. (But it's not :/).

Enemies shoot missiles. If you get hit by a missile, you die. Game over :(
You shoot green lasers. Shooting enemies earns points; you win when all the enemies are gone.
As you shoot more enemies, they will get faster and shoot more frequently. If the enemies collide with the player, the game ends.

View your score in the top right hand corner.

The game starts immediately and will restart, regardless of winning or losing.

### Controls
Press A to move right and D to move left. Shoot using the spacebar.
