***SPACE INVADERS***

The game starts immediately.
To move right: A
To move left: D
To shoot: spacebar

Enemies are the white creatures moving from side to side. 
You are the little green guy at the very bottom. The player may move laterally from side to side, 
but not up and down. 
The green things above the player are bunkers; these serve as shields against the enemies.
If this game were better, these bunkers would deteriorate over time as they get hit with missiles.
But it's not :/.
Enemies shoot missiles. If you get hit by a missile, you die. Game over :(
You shoot green lasers. Shooting enemies earns points; you win when all enemies are gone.
As you shoot more enemies, they will get faster and shoot more frequently. 
If the enemies collide with the player, the game ends.
View your score in the top right hand corner.

In the case of winning or losing, the game simply restarts.
